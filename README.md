## Introduction
With the explosive growth of the amount of information on the Internet, recommender systems play a crucial role to alleviate the problem of information overload. To achieve higher quality and personalized recommendation service, it is of crucial importance to consider the transition between users and items as well as the item contents or attributes from various modalities (e.g., visual, acoustic, and textual).
